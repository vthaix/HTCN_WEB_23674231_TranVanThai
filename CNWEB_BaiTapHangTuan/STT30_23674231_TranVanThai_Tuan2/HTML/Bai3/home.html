                        Welcome to the home page of our family farm, 
                        Sunny Acres, where there's always something 
                        happening. With the coming of fall, 
                        we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest 
                        and Farm Show. If you haven't visited 
                        our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before 
                        it gets torn down on November 5. 
                        This year's maze is bigger and better than ever. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. 
                        Schools and home-schooling parents, 
                        take an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn. 
                        We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean environment. 
                        Kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, 
                        and calves while they learn about nature and the farming life. 
                        Please call ahead for large school groups. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the sun goes down this time of year, 
                        we're all looking for a good fright. 
                        Sunny Acres provides that too with another 
                        year of the Haunted Maze. 
                        Please plan on joining us during weekends 
                        in October or on Halloween 
                        for our big Halloween Festival.

                        Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. 
                        Our Farm Shop is always open 
                        with reasonable prices and great produce. 
                        Save even more money 
                        by picking your own fruits and vegetables 
                        from our orchards and gardens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
                    </p>
